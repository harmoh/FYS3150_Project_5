# Project 5 - Molecular Dynamics
Project 5 in FYS3150 Computational Physics

Abstract:

This project used molecular dynamics to simulate a system of argon atoms. Initial velocities were set by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, intermolecular forces were calculated from the Lennard-Jones potential and the Verlet integrator was used to calculate the positions and velocities of the atoms over time. The melting temperature was found to be in the range between 300 K and 350 K when studying the total energy and temperature evolution for different initial temperatures. The diffusion constant for different temperatures at equilibrium was used to find a melting temperature of slightly below 350 K.
